Using Kart with S3
==================

This page is a placeholder - eventually there will be more documentation on using Kart with S3, which is still in development.

SHA256 hashes
=============

Kart uses `Git LFS <git_lfs_>`_ pointer files to point to point-cloud or raster tiles - even when those tiles
are found in S3, rather than on a Git LFS server. For more details, see the section on :doc:`Git LFS </pages/git_lfs>`
In order to create a dataset where every tile is backed by an object on S3, Kart needs to learn the SHA256
hash of each object in order to populate the pointer file. Currently, it does this by querying S3 directly,
which works as long as the S3 objects already have SHA256 checksums attached (which is not guaranteed).

If you need to add SHA256 hashes to existing S3 objects, this Python snippet using `boto3 <boto3_>`_ could be a
good starting point. It copies an object from `key` to the same `key`, overwriting itself, but adds a SHA256 hash
as it does so. It **does not** preserve the object's ACL - if you have set an ACL on the object, you will need to set
it again.

.. code:: python

   import boto3

   boto3.client("s3").copy_object(
     Bucket=bucket,
     Key=key,
     CopySource=dict(Bucket=bucket, Key=key),
     ChecksumAlgorithm="SHA256",
   )
