# libkart

libkart is a C++ library (with C API) for handling Kart repos. It does not attempt to provide full Kart functionality, but will slowly absorb more of Kart's features over time.

At present this library is in early stages of development, and isn't yet particularly useful. Watch this space!

## Building

Libkart isn't yet integrated with the main kart cmake build system. To do a dev build:

* activate your Kart virtualenv
* cd into the libkart directory
* type `./build.sh`
